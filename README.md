# Machine Learning for Predicting and Exploring Income Inequality

This study focuses on using machine learning to investigate and predict the income gap, particularly based on gender and race.

## Overview

In this project, I employed several machine learning algorithms to analyse and understand income disparities. The following algorithms were utilised:

- Multiple Linear Regression
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest

## Goals

The primary objectives were to:

1. Determine the extent of the gender pay gap by analysing and quantifying the difference in income between men and women.
2. Investigate the influence of race on income by examining and comparing the income levels of individuals from asian, black, and white racial backgrounds.
3. Assess the impact of factors like education and marital status on income by examining their association with income disparities.
4. Explore the capability of machine learning techniques to evaluate, predict and provide insights into social issues such as income disparities.


## Data

The algorithms were trained using the 2021 USA census data, which includes relevant socioeconomic variables. This dataset was carefully selected to facilitate accurate predictions and generate meaningful insights and can be found on https://www.ipums.org/.
